This function can be estimated from experimental data via its empirical counterpart, the empirical attainment function (EAF).

In this article, the problem of computing the empirical attainment function is formalised, and upper and lower bounds on the corresponding number of output points are presented. In addition, efficient algorithms for the two and three-dimensional cases are proposed, and their time complexities are related to lower bounds derived for each case.},
